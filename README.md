# React ToDo App

**Hi!   Nice to see you here.**
This project was written by [me](https://github.com/ChuVo/) as a final project in an online school: [WebHeroSchool](https://webheroschool.ru/)
This project was developed using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Project description
 **My application contains two pages** 
 1. ToDo List - here you can add, delete, sort tasks.
 2. About - here you can see my contacts and a list of my repositories.

## How to work with this project
1. `git clone https://github.com/WebHeroSchool/reactSouslik.git`
2. `cd reactsouslik`
3. `npm install`
4. `nmp start`

You can now view todo in the browser
`Local: http://localhost:3000/`
